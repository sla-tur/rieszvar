This is an implementation of the Riesz estimator algorithms from Aliprantis, Harris, and Tourky (2006b). By Ovchinnikov (2002) and Aliprantis, Harris, and Tourky (2006a), any piecewise linear function on n-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as a Boolean polynomial of its affine (or linear) components. Riesz estimators are the analogue concept for multivariate piecewise linear regressions.

The documentation isn't finished, as I'm still working on paring down the mathematical content, but the 'how-to' presentation contains information on how to retrieve the Boolean representation for a
